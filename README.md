# MSc-Advanced-Project

Final Viedo：


## Introduction
In this project, I created an experiential device game -- Open the "Black Box", inspired by Deep Dream and the world in the eyes of people with colour blindness. In the game, I made a carefully packaged "Stupid AI" -- "A Blind Eye" -- as the main part of the game. The experientier needs to go through a series of explorations and research to obtain the "creative gems" in the "blind eye" and gain a new understanding of creativity. I hope the experiencer can realize that the inherent development thought of blindly pursuing perfection limits people's creativity by exploring this experience game. Especially in the era of rapid technological development, People should not only refrain from fearing the perfectly packaged technology and ideas behind the AI mask but should instead open this 'Black Box' to explore and study. Perhaps what is defined as stupid and imperfect can also be a source of new creativity.
