Final Viedo：


## Introduction
In this project, I created an experiential device game —— Open the "Black Box", inspired by Deep Dream and the world in the eyes of people with colour blindness. In the game, I made a carefully packaged "Stupid AI" —— "A Blind Eye" —— as the main part of the game. The experientier needs to go through a series of explorations and research to obtain the "creative gems" in the "blind eye" and gain a new understanding of creativity. I hope the experiencer can realize that the inherent development thought of blindly pursuing perfection limits people's creativity by exploring this experience game. Especially in the era of rapid technological development, People should not only refrain from fearing the perfectly packaged technology and ideas behind the AI mask but should instead open this 'Black Box' to explore and study. Perhaps what is defined as stupid and imperfect can also be a source of new creativity.

## Inspiration
In my coding3 extension of machine learning research, I found a model called Deep Dream that cleverly uses a machine learning "mistake" - overprocessing discriminative features. Traditional deep learning uses gradient descent to minimize loss. However, the model uses the principle of gradient ascent to process images. It tries to intuitively express the characteristics and style of the picture seen by the machine at each level by increasing the activation value to maximize the expression of the identified single feature.

The creators explored the "stupidity" of neural networks, where excessive recognition and learning allowed each layer to emerge with its own properties. They took this property and used it to process images, abstracting them to form completely new things in images.
With technical iterations, it is even possible to use random noisy images to show the purely "creative" results of neural networks.

I was pleasantly surprised by this fantastic innovative Angle! It also allowed me to see the interesting "soul" of complex and scary machine learning techniques. This started to change my mindset that maybe these wonderful technologies and AI might not be as "perfect" as I thought. But perhaps these imperfections are what make them. I began to explore further.
